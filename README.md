For more information about the image this is based on and its history, please see [the relevant manifest file (`library/wordpress`)](https://github.com/docker-library/official-images/blob/master/library/wordpress). 

For detailed information about the virtual/transfer sizes and individual layers of each of the above supported tags, please see [the `repos/wordpress/tag-details.md` file](https://github.com/docker-library/repo-info/blob/master/repos/wordpress/tag-details.md) in [the `docker-library/repo-info` GitHub repo](https://github.com/docker-library/repo-info).

# How to use this image

```console
$ docker run --name some-wordpress --link some-mysql:mysql -d rizo928/wordpress-php7.1-apache
```

The following environment variables are also honored for configuring your WordPress instance:

-	`-e WORDPRESS_DB_HOST=...` (defaults to the IP and port of the linked `mysql` container)
-	`-e WORDPRESS_DB_USER=...` (defaults to "root")
-	`-e WORDPRESS_DB_PASSWORD=...` (defaults to the value of the `MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD` environment variable from the linked `mysql` container)
-	`-e WORDPRESS_DB_NAME=...` (defaults to "wordpress")
-	`-e WORDPRESS_TABLE_PREFIX=...` (defaults to "", only set this when you need to override the default table prefix in wp-config.php)
-	`-e WORDPRESS_AUTH_KEY=...`, `-e WORDPRESS_SECURE_AUTH_KEY=...`, `-e WORDPRESS_LOGGED_IN_KEY=...`, `-e WORDPRESS_NONCE_KEY=...`, `-e WORDPRESS_AUTH_SALT=...`, `-e WORDPRESS_SECURE_AUTH_SALT=...`, `-e WORDPRESS_LOGGED_IN_SALT=...`, `-e WORDPRESS_NONCE_SALT=...` (default to unique random SHA1s)

If the `WORDPRESS_DB_NAME` specified does not already exist on the given MySQL server, it will be created automatically upon startup of the `wordpress` container, provided that the `WORDPRESS_DB_USER` specified has the necessary permissions to create it.

If you'd like to be able to access the instance from the host without the container's IP, standard port mappings can be used:

```console
$ docker run --name some-wordpress --link some-mysql:mysql -p 8080:80 -d rizo928/wordpress-php7.1-apache
```

Then, access it via `http://localhost:8080` or `http://host-ip:8080` in a browser.

If you'd like to use an external database instead of a linked `mysql` container, specify the hostname and port with `WORDPRESS_DB_HOST` along with the password in `WORDPRESS_DB_PASSWORD` and the username in `WORDPRESS_DB_USER` (if it is something other than `root`):

```console
$ docker run --name some-wordpress -e WORDPRESS_DB_HOST=10.1.2.3:3306 \
    -e WORDPRESS_DB_USER=... -e WORDPRESS_DB_PASSWORD=... -d rizo928/wordpress-php7.1-apache
```

## ... via [`docker-compose`](https://github.com/docker/compose)

Example `docker-compose.yml` for `wordpress`:

```yaml
version: '2'

services:

  wordpress:
    image: rizo928/wordpress-php7.1-apache
    ports:
      - 8080:80
    environment:
      WORDPRESS_DB_PASSWORD: example

  mysql:
    image: mariadb
    environment:
      MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: example
```

Run `docker-compose up`, wait for it to initialize completely, and visit `http://localhost:8080` or `http://host-ip:8080`.

## Adding additional libraries / extensions

This image does not provide any additional PHP extensions or other libraries, even if they are required by popular plugins. There are an infinite number of possible plugins, and they potentially require any extension PHP supports. Including every PHP extension that exists would dramatically increase the image size.

If you need additional PHP extensions, you'll need to create your own image `FROM` this one. The [documentation of the `php` image](https://github.com/docker-library/docs/blob/master/php/README.md#how-to-install-more-php-extensions) explains how to compile additional extensions. Additionally, the [`wordpress` Dockerfile](https://github.com/docker-library/wordpress/blob/618490d4bdff6c5774b84b717979bfe3d6ba8ad1/apache/Dockerfile#L5-L9) has an example of doing this.

The following Docker Hub features can help with the task of keeping your dependent images up-to-date:

-	[Automated Builds](https://docs.docker.com/docker-hub/builds/) let Docker Hub automatically build your Dockerfile each time you push changes to it.
-	[Repository Links](https://docs.docker.com/docker-hub/builds/#repository-links) can ensure that your image is also rebuilt any time `wordpress` is updated.

# Supported Docker versions

This image is officially supported on Docker version 1.13.0.

Support for older versions (down to 1.6) is provided on a best-effort basis.

Please see [the Docker installation documentation](https://docs.docker.com/installation/) for details on how to upgrade your Docker daemon.

# User Feedback

## Issues
